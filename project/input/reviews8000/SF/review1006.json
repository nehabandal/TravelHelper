We enjoyed the service and rooms, and the breakfast was good - it met our expectations for South America noting that it is typically quite different from a full western style a la carte or even buffet breakfast in terms of the offerings. We were very pleased with the comfort and style of the hotel, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the price. We were also very pleased with a 1.30pm check out so that we could enjoy a fully relaxing sleep in.\n\nThe only disappointment was that despite checking in on a week day, the hotel was unable to offer an express service for laundry, as they required more than 24 hours to return laundry and we were leaving the following afternoon. Also phone calls were incredibly expensive, as was the mini bar (somewhat to be expected). Eating at the Italian restaurant next door was pleasant and about 1/3 the price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Very comfortable beds; we booked twin share and were pleased to discover two double beds.
